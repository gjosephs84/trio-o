## Trio-O

## Description
A web-based version of the board game "Otrio." Users take turns moving small, medium, and large-sized circles onto the game board to try to make three-in-a-row tic-tac-toe style. For full details see "How to Play" below.

NOTE: This software was specifically developed as a creative exercise with no intention to distribute or sell it—just the product of a web-developer-in-training stretching his wings. 

## How to Run

## How to Play

Trio-O can be played with 2-4 players. 

# Two Players:

Each player controls the game pieces opposite each other on the board. One player will be red and green. The other blue and purple. Beginning with red, the first player moves any sized game piece onto any available space on the game board. 

Play moves in a clockwise direction, with purple going next.

Continue around until one player's same-colored game pieces achieves the following:

• 3 in a row, horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. Three in a row can either be three of the same color/size, or three of the same color in ascending or descending size.

• 3 of the same color nested (example: small red inside medium red inside large red)

# Three or More Players:

The same rules as above, except each player only controls one color. In the event of three players, omit a fourth color of user's choosing from play.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

I would like to implement functionality that would only allow the color whose turn is currently active to move their pieces.

I would also like to implement code that would check for a winner after each turn.

I'd like to make the size of the board dynamic based on a user's screen size. I'd also like make the dragging functionality work on touch screens so the game could be played on a phone or iPad.

Ultimately, I would like to implement code that would allow two or more players to access a game from separate remote locations.
